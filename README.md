# FitBook

* This is **FitBook**  
  Example usages:
  * as a starting point of a course project (instead of building everything from scratch)  
  * as a case study in software engineering  

* This is an ongoing software project for a desktop application (called _FitBook_) used by **personal trainers** for managing their clients’ information.  
  * It is **written in OOP fashion**. It provides a **reasonably well-written** code base (around 6 KLoC) that is larger than what students usually write in beginner-level SE modules, while still being approachable.  
  * It comes with a **reasonable level of user and developer documentation**.  

* FitBook is designed for **personal trainers** who need to keep track of:  
  * **Client sessions** – schedule and record training sessions  
  * **Payments** – monitor and log client payments  
  * **Body Statistics** – track progress such as weight, body fat %, and strength levels  
  * **Medical Notes** – record important health considerations to personalize training safely  

* It is named `FitBook` because it is an evolution of the `AddressBook` project from the SE-EDU initiative, extended and adapted to the fitness domain.  

* For the detailed documentation of the original project, see the **[Address Book Product Website](https://se-education.org/addressbook-level3)**.  
  * While FitBook has diverged in domain and features, it retains the same solid engineering foundations.  

* This project is a **part of the se-education.org** initiative. If you would like to contribute code to this project, see [se-education.org](https://se-education.org/#contributing-to-se-edu) for more info.  

* FitBook is based on the AddressBook-Level3 project created by the [SE-EDU initiative](https://se-education.org).
